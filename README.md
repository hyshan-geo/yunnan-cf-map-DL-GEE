# coffee distribution map of main production region of Yunnan in 2022 based on DNN and GEE

Coffee, as a perennial commodity crops, plays an important role in global agricultural markets, as well as regional livelihoods and poverty reduction. Yunnan is an emerging coffee producing area, contributing to 98% of China’s total production, as well as 2% of the world’s. Yunnan’s coffee is gaining increasing interest from the global market and playing greater importance in local coffee farmers’ livelihood. Nevertheless, the absence of a high-resolution detailed coffee distribution map has hindered the local environmental research and policy-making related to coffee. Based on Sentinel-2 optical data and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) topographic data provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we use object-based Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) segmentation and Deep Neural Network to produce the first 10m coffee distribution map of Yunnan in 2022. The overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy and F1 score of our binary coffee mapping is 0.91, 0.91, 0.98, and 0.8. Our data can provide an important foundation for further understanding the deforestation, sustainable development, livelihood protection related to coffee in the region, as well as simulating the relationship between coffee and climate change in the area.
